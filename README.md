# Mini Transformer in AWK: A Detailed Documentation

## 1. High-Level Overview

This document provides a detailed explanation of the `Mini Transformer` implemented in AWK. This script is designed for both training and generation tasks, featuring a simplified transformer architecture. It includes Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for tokenization, multi-head attention, a feed-forward network (FFN), and mechanisms for saving and loading the trained model.

### Code Structure:

The script is organized into several key sections:

*   **BPE Tokenization Functions**: Handles the tokenization of input text using Byte Pair Encoding.
*   **Helper Functions**: Provides utility functions for common mathematical operations and array indexing.
*   **Initialization / Hyperparameters**: Defines the model's configuration and sets up the environment for training or generation.
*   **Multi-head Attention**: Implements the core multi-head attention mechanism with causal masking.
*   **Forward + Backprop**: Contains the logic for the forward pass and backpropagation during training.
*   **Forward-only Logits**: Used for generating new tokens based on a given context during inference.
*   **Saving / Loading Model**: Functions to persist and restore the model's learned parameters and BPE merges.





## 2. Global Variables and Hyperparameters

This section details the global variables and hyperparameters that configure the Mini Transformer's behavior, including its architecture, training parameters, and BPE tokenization settings. These values are initialized in the `BEGIN` block of the AWK script and are crucial for understanding the model's operational characteristics.

### Hyperparameters:

*   `d`: This variable represents the **dimension of the model's embeddings and hidden states**. In transformer architectures, `d` (often referred to as `d_model`) is a critical parameter that determines the capacity of the model to learn complex representations. A larger `d` allows for more expressive embeddings but also increases computational cost and memory usage. In this AWK implementation, `d` is set to `8`, indicating a very small model suitable for demonstration and educational purposes, rather than high-performance tasks.

*   `d_ff`: This parameter defines the **dimension of the inner layer of the feed-forward network (FFN)** within each transformer block. The FFN typically consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between. The first linear layer expands the dimensionality from `d` to `d_ff`, and the second projects it back to `d`. A larger `d_ff` (relative to `d`) allows the FFN to learn more complex non-linear transformations. Here, `d_ff` is set to `16`, which is twice the size of `d`, a common practice in many transformer variants.

*   `n_heads`: This specifies the **number of attention heads** in the multi-head attention mechanism. Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different positions. Each head learns a different set of attention weights. The outputs from these heads are then concatenated and linearly transformed. The value `4` for `n_heads` means the model can capture four different types of relationships or features simultaneously. It's important that `d` is divisible by `n_heads` to ensure `d_head` (dimension per head) is an integer.

*   `d_head`: This derived hyperparameter represents the **dimension of each attention head**. It is calculated as `d / n_heads`. For this model, `d_head` is `8 / 4 = 2`. This means each of the four attention heads processes a 2-dimensional representation of the input, which is then combined to form the full `d`-dimensional output.

*   `block_size`: This parameter determines the **maximum sequence length** that the transformer can process in a single block. It is also known as the context window or sequence length. A larger `block_size` allows the model to consider longer dependencies in the input sequence but significantly increases memory and computational requirements, especially during attention calculations (which are quadratic with respect to sequence length). Here, `block_size` is set to `50`, meaning the model can process sequences up to 50 tokens long.

*   `epochs`: This defines the **total number of training iterations** over the entire dataset. An epoch represents one complete pass through the training data. More epochs generally lead to better model convergence and performance, but also increase training time and the risk of overfitting. The script sets `epochs` to `1000`, indicating a substantial training duration for this mini-transformer.

*   `lr`: This is the **learning rate**, a crucial hyperparameter that controls the step size during the optimization process (gradient descent). A smaller learning rate leads to slower but potentially more stable training, while a larger learning rate can speed up training but might cause oscillations or divergence. The learning rate `0.005` is a relatively small value, suggesting a cautious approach to weight updates.

*   `clip`: This parameter is used for **gradient clipping**, a technique to prevent exploding gradients during training. If the magnitude of gradients exceeds this `clip` value, they are scaled down. This helps stabilize training, especially in deep neural networks. A `clip` value of `0.5` means that gradients will be capped at this absolute value.

*   `gen_tokens`: This specifies the **number of tokens to generate** during the inference (generation) phase. When the model is in 'generate' mode, it will produce a sequence of this many tokens after being prompted with an initial context. `gen_tokens` is set to `40`, meaning the model will generate a short sequence.

*   `temp`: This is the **temperature parameter** used in the softmax function during token generation. Temperature controls the randomness of the predictions. A higher temperature (e.g., >1) makes the output distribution flatter, increasing the probability of less likely tokens and leading to more diverse but potentially less coherent outputs. A lower temperature (e.g., <1) makes the distribution sharper, favoring more probable tokens and resulting in more conservative but potentially more predictable outputs. A `temp` of `1000` is extremely high, which would make the output almost uniformly random, effectively ignoring the learned probabilities. This value might be a placeholder or intended for specific experimental behavior.

*   `bpe_merges`: This defines the **number of merge operations** to perform during Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) training. BPE is a subword tokenization algorithm that iteratively merges the most frequent pairs of characters or character sequences into new tokens. A higher `bpe_merges` value results in a larger vocabulary of subword units, potentially capturing more complex linguistic patterns but also increasing the vocabulary size. `bpe_merges` is set to `250`, indicating that 250 merge operations will be performed to build the BPE vocabulary.

### Global Variables (Dynamically Populated):

*   `V`: This variable stores the **size of the vocabulary**. It is dynamically determined during the BPE tokenization process. `V` includes all individual characters and the newly formed merged tokens. It represents the total number of unique tokens that the model can process or generate.

*   `token2id`: An associative array (or hash map) that maps **tokens (strings) to their unique integer IDs**. This is essential for converting textual input into numerical representations that the model can process. For example, `token2id[


hello"]` might return `123`.

*   `id2token`: The inverse of `token2id`, this associative array maps **unique integer IDs back to their corresponding tokens (strings)**. This is used to convert the model's numerical outputs back into human-readable text. For example, `id2token[123]` would return `"hello"`.

*   `bpe_seq`: An array used internally during the BPE training process to hold the current sequence of tokens being processed for merges.

*   `num_ranked_merges`: Stores the actual number of merges performed during BPE training. This can be less than `bpe_merges` if no more frequent pairs are found.

*   `ranked_merges`: A 2D associative array that stores the learned BPE merges. `ranked_merges[m, "p1"]` and `ranked_merges[m, "p2"]` store the two tokens that were merged, and `ranked_merges[m, "new"]` stores the new token formed by their concatenation, for the `m`-th merge operation.

*   `seq`: An array that holds the sequence of token IDs after BPE tokenization, ready for input to the transformer model.

*   `E`: This represents the **embedding matrix**. It maps each token ID to a dense vector representation of size `d`. Both input embeddings and output embeddings (for the final linear layer) share this matrix, a technique known as weight-tying. The dimensions of `E` are `V x d`.

*   `P`: This is the **positional encoding matrix**. Positional encodings are added to the input embeddings to inject information about the relative or absolute position of tokens in the sequence, as transformers themselves are permutation-invariant. The dimensions of `P` are `block_size x d`.

*   `WQ`, `WK`, `WV`: These are the **weight matrices for the Query, Key, and Value transformations** in the multi-head attention mechanism. For each attention head, the input `X` is linearly transformed using these matrices to produce Query (`Q`), Key (`K`), and Value (`V`) vectors. The dimensions of these matrices are `d x d`.

*   `W_out`: This is the **output weight matrix** for the multi-head attention mechanism. After the outputs from all attention heads are concatenated, `W_out` linearly transforms this concatenated vector back to the model's hidden dimension `d`. The dimensions of `W_out` are `d x d`.

*   `W1`, `W2`: These are the **weight matrices for the two linear layers in the Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**. `W1` transforms the input from `d` to `d_ff`, and `W2` transforms it back from `d_ff` to `d`. The dimensions are `d x d_ff` for `W1` and `d_ff x d` for `W2`.

*   `X`: An array used to store the **input embeddings combined with positional encodings** for a given block of tokens. Its dimensions are `block_len x d`.

*   `attn_out`: An array to store the **output of the multi-head attention mechanism** before the residual connection and FFN. Its dimensions are `block_len x d`.

*   `Z1`: An array to store the **output of the first linear layer of the FFN** after applying the ReLU activation (or similar non-linearity). Its dimensions are `block_len x d_ff`.

*   `Y2`: An array to store the **output of the FFN** after the second linear layer and residual connection. Its dimensions are `block_len x d`.

*   `logits_t`: An array to store the **raw, unnormalized scores (logits)** for each possible next token at each position `t` in a block. These are computed by multiplying `Y2` with the transpose of the embedding matrix `E`. Its dimensions are `block_len x V`.

*   `V_head_h`: An array used internally within the `multihead_attention` function to store the **Value vectors for each head**. Its dimensions are `block_len x d_head`.

*   `SCO_head`: An array used internally within `multihead_attention` to store the **scaled attention scores** for each head before softmax. Its dimensions are `block_len x d_head`.

*   `Pmat_head`: An array used internally within `multihead_attention` to store the **attention probabilities** for each head after softmax. Its dimensions are `block_len x d_head`.

*   `concat_head`: An array used internally within `multihead_attention` to store the **concatenated outputs of all attention heads** before the final linear projection. Its dimensions are `block_len x d`.

*   `dWQ_acc`, `dWK_acc`, `dWV_acc`, `dW_out_acc`, `dW1_acc`, `dW2_acc`: These are **accumulator arrays for gradients** during backpropagation. They store the sum of gradients for the respective weight matrices across a training block before applying the weight updates. Their dimensions match the corresponding weight matrices.

*   `z1mask`: An array used in the FFN during backpropagation to store a mask indicating which elements of `Z1` were positive (and thus had a non-zero gradient) after the ReLU activation. Its dimensions are `block_len x d_ff`.

*   `dz1_row`: A temporary array used during backpropagation through the FFN to store gradients related to the first FFN layer.

*   `d_attn_out`: A temporary array used during backpropagation to store gradients flowing back into the output of the attention mechanism.

*   `dQ`, `dK`, `dV`: Temporary arrays used during backpropagation through the multi-head attention to store gradients for the Query, Key, and Value vectors, respectively.

*   `tgt`: An array holding the target (ground truth) token IDs for a given sequence, used during training to calculate the loss.

This comprehensive set of variables and hyperparameters forms the backbone of the AWK Mini Transformer, enabling its training and generation capabilities. Understanding their roles is fundamental to grasping the model's operation and its simplified implementation of the transformer architecture.



## 3. Functions

This section provides a detailed explanation of each function within the AWK Mini Transformer script, outlining their purpose, parameters (inputs), and return values (outputs). Understanding these functions is key to comprehending the step-by-step operation of the transformer, from tokenization to training and generation.

### 3.1 BPE Tokenization Functions

These functions are responsible for implementing the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm, which is used to convert raw text into a sequence of subword tokens. BPE helps manage vocabulary size and handle out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them down into known subword units.

*   `function get_pair_stats(tokens, n, stats, i, pair)`
    *   **Purpose**: This function calculates the frequency of adjacent token pairs within a given sequence. It is a crucial step in the BPE algorithm, as BPE iteratively merges the most frequent pairs.
    *   **Inputs**:
        *   `tokens`: An array containing the sequence of tokens (e.g., individual characters or previously merged subwords).
        *   `n`: The number of tokens in the `tokens` array.
    *   **Outputs**:
        *   `stats`: An associative array (passed by reference) where keys are token pairs (e.g., "t\ta" for the pair "t" and "a") and values are their frequencies. This array is populated by the function.
    *   **Internal Logic**: It iterates through the `tokens` array, forming pairs of adjacent tokens and incrementing their count in the `stats` array.

*   `function merge_sequence(tokens, n, pair_str, new_token, new_tokens, new_n, i, p1, p2, pair_parts)`
    *   **Purpose**: This function performs a single merge operation in the BPE algorithm. It replaces all occurrences of a specified token pair with a new, merged token within a sequence.
    *   **Inputs**:
        *   `tokens`: An array containing the sequence of tokens to be modified.
        *   `n`: The current number of tokens in the `tokens` array.
        *   `pair_str`: A string representing the token pair to be merged, with tokens separated by `OFS` (Output Field Separator, typically a tab). For example, "t\ta".
        *   `new_token`: The new token (string) that will replace the `pair_str`. For example, "ta".
    *   **Outputs**:
        *   `tokens`: The modified `tokens` array (passed by reference) with the specified pair replaced by the `new_token`.
        *   `n`: The updated number of tokens in the `tokens` array after the merge (returned by the function).
    *   **Internal Logic**: It splits `pair_str` into its constituent parts (`p1`, `p2`). It then iterates through the `tokens` array. When `p1` followed by `p2` is found, they are replaced by `new_token`. Otherwise, the token is copied as is. The `tokens` array is then updated with the `new_tokens`.

*   `function train_bpe(text, num_merges, i, char, n, m, pair_parts, pair_stats, best_pair, max_freq, new_token)`
    *   **Purpose**: This is the main function for training the BPE tokenizer. It learns a vocabulary of subword units by iteratively merging the most frequent adjacent character or subword pairs in the input text.
    *   **Inputs**:
        *   `text`: The raw input text (string) on which BPE training will be performed.
        *   `num_merges`: The maximum number of merge operations to perform. The training might stop earlier if no more frequent pairs are found.
    *   **Outputs**:
        *   `V`: The final size of the vocabulary (global variable `V`).
        *   `token2id`: The mapping from tokens to their IDs (global associative array `token2id`).
        *   `id2token`: The mapping from IDs to tokens (global associative array `id2token`).
        *   `num_ranked_merges`: The actual number of merges performed (global variable `num_ranked_merges`).
        *   `ranked_merges`: The learned merge operations (global 2D associative array `ranked_merges`).
    *   **Internal Logic**: 
        1.  **Initialization**: It initializes the vocabulary with all unique characters from the input `text` and assigns them initial IDs. The `bpe_seq` array is populated with individual characters.
        2.  **Iterative Merging**: It loops `num_merges` times (or until no more merges are possible):
            *   Calls `get_pair_stats` to find frequencies of all adjacent pairs in `bpe_seq`.
            *   Identifies the `best_pair` (most frequent pair).
            *   If no `best_pair` or its frequency is less than 2, training stops.
            *   Creates a `new_token` by concatenating the `best_pair`.
            *   Adds `new_token` to the vocabulary (`token2id`, `id2token`) if it's new.
            *   Records the merge operation in `ranked_merges`.
            *   Calls `merge_sequence` to update `bpe_seq` with the `new_token`.
        3.  **Reporting**: Prints progress and final statistics about the BPE training.

*   `function tokenize_bpe(text, n, i, m, new_n, p1, p2, new_tok, tokens, new_tokens)`
    *   **Purpose**: This function tokenizes a given input `text` using the BPE merges learned during the `train_bpe` process. It converts the raw text into a sequence of token IDs that the transformer model can understand.
    *   **Inputs**:
        *   `text`: The raw input text (string) to be tokenized.
    *   **Outputs**:
        *   `seq`: An array containing the sequence of token IDs (global array `seq`).
        *   `T`: The number of tokens in the `seq` array (global variable `T`).
    *   **Internal Logic**: 
        1.  **Initial Character Split**: The input `text` is first split into individual characters, which form the initial `tokens` array.
        2.  **Applying Merges**: It iterates through the `ranked_merges` (learned during training) in the order they were learned. For each merge, it applies the `merge_sequence` logic to the current `tokens` array, effectively replacing learned pairs with their merged tokens.
        3.  **Conversion to IDs**: Finally, it converts the resulting sequence of tokens into their corresponding integer IDs using the `token2id` mapping and stores them in the global `seq` array.

### 3.2 Helper Functions

These are utility functions that provide common operations used throughout the transformer implementation, such as array indexing, numerical clamping, and safe mathematical operations.

*   `function idx(i, j, cols)`
    *   **Purpose**: This function calculates a 1D index for a 2D array (or matrix) stored in a 1D associative array. AWK does not natively support multi-dimensional arrays in the way some other languages do, so this helper is used to simulate 2D indexing.
    *   **Inputs**:
        *   `i`: The row index (1-based).
        *   `j`: The column index (1-based).
        *   `cols`: The number of columns in the conceptual 2D array.
    *   **Output**: A single integer representing the 1D index.
    *   **Example**: `idx(2, 3, 5)` would return `(2-1)*5 + 3 = 8`. This means the element at row 2, column 3 of a 2D array with 5 columns would be stored at index 8 in a 1D array.

*   `function dot_row(A, ri, B, rj, d, s, k)`
    *   **Purpose**: This function calculates the dot product of a specified row from matrix `A` and a specified row from matrix `B`. This is a common operation in linear algebra, particularly for matrix multiplications.
    *   **Inputs**:
        *   `A`: The first matrix (represented as a 1D associative array using `idx` for 2D access).
        *   `ri`: The row index from matrix `A` to use.
        *   `B`: The second matrix (represented as a 1D associative array).
        *   `rj`: The row index from matrix `B` to use.
        *   `d`: The dimension (number of columns) of the rows being dotted.
    *   **Output**: The scalar dot product of the two rows.
    *   **Internal Logic**: It iterates `d` times, multiplying corresponding elements from the specified rows of `A` and `B` and summing the products.

*   `function clamp_inplace(A, n, val, i)`
    *   **Purpose**: This function clamps the values in an array `A` in-place, meaning it modifies the array directly. Any value in `A` that is greater than `val` is set to `val`, and any value less than `-val` is set to `-val`. This is typically used for gradient clipping to prevent numerical instability during training.
    *   **Inputs**:
        *   `A`: The array whose values are to be clamped.
        *   `n`: The number of elements in the array `A` to process.
        *   `val`: The maximum absolute value to which elements will be clamped.
    *   **Outputs**: The `A` array is modified in-place.
    *   **Internal Logic**: It iterates through the first `n` elements of `A` and applies the clamping logic.

*   `function safe_exp(x)`
    *   **Purpose**: This function computes the exponential of `x` (`e^x`) but includes a safeguard against numerical underflow. If `x` is a very small negative number (e.g., less than -700), `exp(x)` would result in a value very close to zero, which can lead to issues in floating-point arithmetic. This function returns `0` in such cases.
    *   **Inputs**:
        *   `x`: The number for which to compute the exponential.
    *   **Output**: `e^x` or `0` if `x` is too small.

*   `function safe_div(a, b)`
    *   **Purpose**: This function performs division (`a / b`) but includes a safeguard against division by zero. If the denominator `b` is zero, it returns `0` instead of causing a runtime error or `NaN`.
    *   **Inputs**:
        *   `a`: The numerator.
        *   `b`: The denominator.
    *   **Output**: The result of `a / b` or `0` if `b` is zero.

### 3.3 Core Transformer Functions

These functions implement the main components of the transformer architecture, including multi-head attention, the feed-forward network, and the forward/backward passes for training and inference.

*   `function multihead_attention(X, block_len, d, n_heads, d_head, WQ, WK, WV, W_out, attn_out, h, t, k, j, i, maxs, den, SCO_head, Pmat_head, ctx_h, concat_head, V_head_h)`
    *   **Purpose**: This function implements the multi-head self-attention mechanism, a core component of the transformer. It allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input sequence when processing each token. This implementation includes causal masking, meaning a token can only attend to previous tokens in the sequence.
    *   **Inputs**:
        *   `X`: The input tensor (embeddings + positional encodings) for the current block, with dimensions `block_len x d`.
        *   `block_len`: The length of the current sequence block.
        *   `d`: The model's embedding dimension.
        *   `n_heads`: The number of attention heads.
        *   `d_head`: The dimension of each attention head (`d / n_heads`).
        *   `WQ`, `WK`, `WV`: Weight matrices for Query, Key, and Value transformations.
        *   `W_out`: Output weight matrix for combining attention heads.
    *   **Outputs**:
        *   `attn_out`: The output of the multi-head attention layer, with dimensions `block_len x d` (passed by reference).
        *   `V_head_h`: Internal storage for Value vectors per head (passed by reference).
        *   `SCO_head`: Internal storage for scaled attention scores per head (passed by reference).
        *   `Pmat_head`: Internal storage for attention probabilities per head (passed by reference).
        *   `concat_head`: Internal storage for concatenated head outputs (passed by reference).
    *   **Internal Logic**: 
        1.  **Initialize `concat_head`**: Sets up an array to accumulate the outputs from each attention head.
        2.  **Loop through `n_heads`**: For each attention head:
            *   **Compute Q, K, V**: For each token `t` in the `block_len`, it computes Query (`Q_head`), Key (`K_head`), and Value (`V_head`) vectors by multiplying the input `X` with the head-specific portions of `WQ`, `WK`, and `WV`.
            *   **Calculate Scaled Attention Scores (`SCO_head`)**: Computes the dot product of `Q_head` and `K_head`, scaled by the square root of `d_head`. This is the core attention score.
            *   **Compute Attention Probabilities (`Pmat_head`)**: Applies a causal mask (only attends to previous tokens) and then the softmax function to `SCO_head` to get attention probabilities. This involves finding the maximum value (`maxs`) for numerical stability and then using `safe_exp` and `safe_div`.
            *   **Compute Context Vector (`ctx_h`)**: Calculates the weighted sum of `V_head` vectors using the `Pmat_head` probabilities. This forms the context for the current token.
            *   **Accumulate `concat_head`**: The `ctx_h` for the current head is accumulated into the `concat_head` array.
        3.  **Project `concat_head`**: After processing all heads, the `concat_head` (which has dimensions `block_len x (n_heads * d_head) = block_len x d`) is linearly transformed using the `W_out` matrix to produce the final `attn_out`.

*   `function process_block(start, end, block_len, t, i, j, p, loss, y, val, X, Q, K, Vv, ctx, attn_out, z1, z1mask, y2, logits_t, dy2, dW2_acc, dW1_acc, dz1_row, d_attn_out, dctx, dV_acc, dSCO, dQ, dK, dWQ_acc, dWK_acc, dWV_acc, dW_out_acc, dX, dPtmp, m, den, py_log, g, sum_v, sum_p_dp, s, dqj, dkj, dvj, tok_id)`
    *   **Purpose**: This is the main training function that performs a forward pass and backpropagation for a single block of tokens. It calculates the loss and updates the model's weights based on the gradients.
    *   **Inputs**:
        *   `start`: The starting index of the block in the input sequence.
        *   `end`: The ending index of the block in the input sequence.
    *   **Outputs**:
        *   `loss`: The calculated loss for the current block (returned by the function).
        *   All global weight matrices (`E`, `P`, `WQ`, `WK`, `WV`, `W_out`, `W1`, `W2`) are updated in-place.
    *   **Internal Logic**: 
        1.  **Embeddings + Positional Encoding**: Combines token embeddings (`E`) with positional encodings (`P`) to create the input `X` for the transformer block.
        2.  **Multi-head Attention**: Calls `multihead_attention` to compute the attention output (`attn_out`).
        3.  **Residual Connection (Attention)**: Adds the input `X` to `attn_out` (first residual connection).
        4.  **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**: 
            *   Applies the first linear transformation (`W1`) and ReLU activation to `attn_out` to get `Z1`.
            *   Applies the second linear transformation (`W2`) to `Z1` to get `y2`.
            *   Adds `attn_out` to `y2` (second residual connection) to get `Y2`.
        5.  **Output Layer (Logits)**: Multiplies `Y2` with the transpose of the embedding matrix `E` to compute the raw logits (`logits_t`) for each possible next token.
        6.  **Initialize Accumulators**: Resets gradient accumulators (`dWQ_acc`, `dWK_acc`, etc.) to zero.
        7.  **Compute Loss and Gradients (Backpropagation)**: For each token `t` in the block:
            *   **Softmax**: Computes the softmax probabilities from `logits_t` for the target token `y`.
            *   **Loss Calculation**: Calculates the cross-entropy loss.
            *   **Gradients for Output Layer**: Computes gradients for the output layer and updates `E` and `dW2_acc`.
            *   **Backprop through FFN**: Computes gradients for `W1` and `W2` and propagates them backward.
            *   **Backprop through Attention**: Computes gradients for `WQ`, `WK`, `WV`, and `W_out` and propagates them backward.
        8.  **Update Weights**: Applies the accumulated gradients to update all weight matrices (`WQ`, `WK`, `WV`, `W_out`, `W1`, `W2`) using the learning rate `lr`.
        9.  **Clip Gradients**: Applies `clamp_inplace` to all weight matrices to prevent exploding gradients.

*   `function forward_logits_for_context(ctx_ids, L, logits, t, i, j, X, attn_out, z, z1, y, last_t)`
    *   **Purpose**: This function performs a forward pass through the transformer to compute the logits for the next token, given a context of previous token IDs. This is used during the generation (inference) phase, where the model predicts the next token based on the sequence it has generated so far.
    *   **Inputs**:
        *   `ctx_ids`: An array containing the token IDs of the context sequence.
        *   `L`: The length of the context sequence.
    *   **Outputs**:
        *   `logits`: An associative array (passed by reference) containing the raw, unnormalized scores for each possible next token in the vocabulary. The index of the array corresponds to the token ID, and the value is its logit.
    *   **Internal Logic**: 
        1.  **Embeddings + Positional Encoding**: Similar to `process_block`, it combines token embeddings (`E`) with positional encodings (`P`) for the `ctx_ids` to create `X`.
        2.  **Multi-head Attention**: Calls `multihead_attention` to compute `attn_out`.
        3.  **Residual Connection (Attention)**: Adds `X` to `attn_out`.
        4.  **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**: Applies the FFN transformations (linear layers with ReLU) to `attn_out` to get `Y2`.
        5.  **Output Layer**: Computes the logits for the *last token* in the sequence (`last_t = L`) by multiplying `Y2[last_t]` with the transpose of the embedding matrix `E`. These logits represent the model's prediction for the next token.
        6.  **Cleanup**: Deletes temporary arrays to free up memory.

### 3.4 Model Saving/Loading Functions

These functions handle the persistence of the trained model, allowing its state (weights, vocabulary, BPE merges) to be saved to a file and loaded back for continued training or inference.

*   `function save_model(fname, i)`
    *   **Purpose**: This function saves the current state of the trained transformer model to a specified file. This includes hyperparameters, vocabulary mappings, BPE merges, and all learned weight matrices.
    *   **Inputs**:
        *   `fname`: The filename (string) where the model will be saved.
    *   **Outputs**: The model's state is written to the file specified by `fname`.
    *   **Internal Logic**: 
        1.  **Truncate File**: Ensures the output file is empty before writing.
        2.  **Write Metadata**: Writes comments and key hyperparameters (`V`, `d`, `d_ff`, `n_heads`, `block_size`, `num_ranked_merges`) to the file.
        3.  **Write Vocabulary**: Iterates through `token2id` and `id2token` and writes their contents.
        4.  **Write BPE Merges**: Iterates through `ranked_merges` and writes each learned merge operation.
        5.  **Dump Arrays**: Calls `dump_array` for each weight matrix (`E`, `P`, `WQ`, `WK`, `WV`, `W_out`, `W1`, `W2`) to write their numerical values to the file.

*   `function dump_array(name, A, n, fname, i)`
    *   **Purpose**: A helper function used by `save_model` to write the contents of a numerical array to a file in a specific format.
    *   **Inputs**:
        *   `name`: The name of the array (string, e.g., "E", "P").
        *   `A`: The array whose contents are to be written.
        *   `n`: The number of elements in the array to write.
        *   `fname`: The filename to which the array contents will be appended.
    *   **Outputs**: The array contents are appended to the file specified by `fname`.
    *   **Internal Logic**: It iterates from `1` to `n` and writes each element `A[i]` in the format `name[i]=value` to the file.

*   `function load_model(fname, line, key, val, m, arr, idxv)`
    *   **Purpose**: This function loads a previously saved transformer model from a specified file, restoring its hyperparameters, vocabulary, BPE merges, and all learned weight matrices.
    *   **Inputs**:
        *   `fname`: The filename (string) from which the model will be loaded.
    *   **Outputs**: All global variables and arrays related to the model's state (`V`, `d`, `d_ff`, `n_heads`, `block_size`, `num_ranked_merges`, `token2id`, `id2token`, `ranked_merges`, `E`, `P`, `WQ`, `WK`, `WV`, `W_out`, `W1`, `W2`) are populated with the loaded values.
    *   **Internal Logic**: 
        1.  **Read File Line by Line**: It reads the model file line by line.
        2.  **Parse Key-Value Pairs**: For each line, it parses the `key=value` format.
        3.  **Assign Values**: Based on the `key`, it assigns the `val` to the corresponding global variable or array element. It uses regular expressions (`match`) to extract array names and indices.

This detailed breakdown of each function provides a comprehensive understanding of how the AWK Mini Transformer operates at a functional level. The next section will delve into providing example values for these functions to further illustrate their behavior.



## 4. Diagrams

Visual representations are essential for understanding complex architectures like the Transformer. This section provides diagrams to illustrate the overall flow of the Mini Transformer and the intricate details of its multi-head attention mechanism.

### 4.1 Overall Transformer Architecture

The diagram below illustrates the high-level architecture of the AWK Mini Transformer, showing the flow of data from input text to the final output prediction. It highlights the key components: BPE Tokenization, Embeddings with Positional Encoding, the Transformer Block (comprising Multi-Head Attention and a Feed-Forward Network), and the final Output Layer.

### 4.2 Multi-Head Attention Mechanism

The multi-head attention mechanism is a cornerstone of the Transformer architecture, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. The simplified diagram below illustrates the core steps involved in one attention head and how multiple heads are combined.

![Multi-Head Attention Mechanism](https://private-us-east-1.manuscdn.com/sessionFile/uCvjcLtrnqkNWAXGU9gZ5M/sandbox/VoDtmaAOJvvzpp1o6SwThq-images_1756406225836_na1fn_L2hvbWUvdWJ1bnR1L211bHRpaGVhZF9hdHRlbnRpb24.png?Policy=eyJTdGF0ZW1lbnQiOlt7IlJlc291cmNlIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9wcml2YXRlLXVzLWVhc3QtMS5tYW51c2Nkbi5jb20vc2Vzc2lvbkZpbGUvdUN2amNMdHJucWtOV0FYR1U5Z1o1TS9zYW5kYm94L1ZvRHRtYUFPSnZ2enBwMW82U3dUaHEtaW1hZ2VzXzE3NTY0MDYyMjU4MzZfbmExZm5fTDJodmJXVXZkV0oxYm5SMUwyMTFiSFJwYUdWaFpGOWhkSFJsYm5ScGIyNC5wbmciLCJDb25kaXRpb24iOnsiRGF0ZUxlc3NUaGFuIjp7IkFXUzpFcG9jaFRpbWUiOjE3OTg3NjE2MDB9fX1dfQ__&Key-Pair-Id=K2HSFNDJXOU9YS&Signature=QzH8CirvY7NWwCedYSMydIUfDz4VKWRjZKcmEs5mljP~YW6~8OsNd~-qmdZTdVkxDA6XvGs7pep51kTkihu73HozSuhxMePkytu~3q1-0GtHoQpv1SbmwBwUr3L49BHu2UClinO3l8Mskmw2bvkgC7-BGTRrNshb6XX~BqXKN5Kvxsk-5M7g1R7jRa8YTDGAQDOKIo3UmZBwPVOjhWYlT~q4e24x0oMFqGLP~VzABkFpI2v1x6pjsMhan4tl4M9vPrhYS9D2DUhxIqcluem5VGtEopO6yCa0KX8wD~wBgX7y-v0EmAr39gXaiD0ut--OKAdapKvfwzy7h1PwtLYkyA__)

**Explanation of the Multi-Head Attention Flow:**

1.  **Input (X)**: The input to the attention mechanism is a sequence of embeddings (combined with positional encodings).
2.  **Linear Transformations (WQ, WK, WV)**: For each head, the input `X` is linearly transformed into three different representations: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V). These transformations are learned during training.
3.  **Dot Product (Q.K^T)**: The Query and Key matrices are multiplied to compute attention scores. This dot product indicates how much each word in the input sequence is related to every other word.
4.  **Scaling**: The attention scores are scaled down by the square root of the dimension of the keys (`d_head`). This scaling helps to prevent the dot products from becoming too large, which could push the softmax function into regions with very small gradients.
5.  **Masking (Causal)**: For decoder-like operations (such as in this Mini Transformer for text generation), a causal mask is applied. This ensures that a token can only attend to previous tokens in the sequence, preventing information leakage from future tokens.
6.  **Softmax**: A softmax function is applied to the scaled and masked attention scores. This converts the scores into probabilities, indicating the weight or importance of each input token when computing the output for a specific position.
7.  **Weighted Sum (Attention Scores.V)**: The softmax probabilities are then multiplied by the Value matrix (V). This step effectively creates a weighted sum of the Value vectors, where the weights are the attention probabilities. This weighted sum represents the context-aware representation for each token.
8.  **Output for Head**: The result is the output for a single attention head.
9.  **Concatenate Heads**: The outputs from all individual attention heads are concatenated. Since each head focuses on different aspects of the input, concatenating their outputs allows the model to capture a richer and more diverse set of relationships.
10. **Linear Output (W_out)**: Finally, the concatenated output is passed through another linear layer (`W_out`). This transformation projects the combined outputs of all heads back into the model's original hidden dimension (`d`), producing the final multi-head attention output.

This process allows the transformer to efficiently process sequences by simultaneously attending to various parts of the input, capturing both local and global dependencies within the data.





## 5. Example Values for Functions

To further clarify the functionality of the AWK Mini Transformer, this section provides concrete examples of inputs and outputs for some of its key functions. Due to the complexity and scale of the full transformer operations, detailed numerical examples for functions like `multihead_attention` or `process_block` would be excessively long and difficult to follow. Instead, we will focus on illustrative examples for the helper and BPE tokenization functions, and conceptual examples for the core transformer components.

### 5.1 Helper Functions Examples

#### `idx(i, j, cols)`

This function translates 2D conceptual array indices into a 1D index for AWK's associative arrays.

*   **Scenario**: Imagine a 2D matrix with 5 columns, and we want to access the element at row 2, column 3.
*   **Inputs**:
    *   `i` (row index): `2`
    *   `j` (column index): `3`
    *   `cols` (number of columns): `5`
*   **Calculation**:
    `result = (i - 1) * cols + j`
    `result = (2 - 1) * 5 + 3`
    `result = 1 * 5 + 3`
    `result = 5 + 3`
    `result = 8`
*   **Output**:
    `8`

This means that the element conceptually at `[2, 3]` in a 5-column matrix would be stored at index `8` in the flat AWK array.

#### `safe_exp(x)`

This function computes `e^x` safely, preventing underflow for very small negative inputs.

*   **Scenario 1**: A typical positive input.
*   **Inputs**:
    *   `x`: `1.0`
*   **Calculation**:
    `exp(1.0)`
*   **Output**:
    `2.71828...`

*   **Scenario 2**: A very small negative input that would typically cause underflow.
*   **Inputs**:
    *   `x`: `-800.0` (where `exp(-800)` is practically zero)
*   **Calculation**:
    `if (x < -700) return 0; else return exp(x)`
*   **Output**:
    `0`

#### `safe_div(a, b)`

This function performs division safely, handling division by zero.

*   **Scenario 1**: Normal division.
*   **Inputs**:
    *   `a`: `10`
    *   `b`: `2`
*   **Calculation**:
    `10 / 2`
*   **Output**:
    `5`

*   **Scenario 2**: Division by zero.
*   **Inputs**:
    *   `a`: `5`
    *   `b`: `0`
*   **Calculation**:
    `if (b == 0) return 0; else return a / b`
*   **Output**:
    `0`

### 5.2 BPE Tokenization Functions Examples

#### `get_pair_stats(tokens, n, stats)`

This function counts the frequency of adjacent token pairs.

*   **Scenario**: Analyzing a short sequence of tokens to find common pairs.
*   **Inputs**:
  
    *   `tokens`: `["a", "b", "a", "b", "c"]`
    *   `n`: `5`
*   **Internal Process**:
    *   Pair 1: `(
"a", "b")` -> count = 1
    *   Pair 2: `("b", "a")` -> count = 1
    *   Pair 3: `("a", "b")` -> count = 2
    *   Pair 4: `("b", "c")` -> count = 1
*   **Output (conceptual `stats` array)**:
    ```
    stats["a\tb"] = 2
    stats["b\ta"] = 1
    stats["b\tc"] = 1
    ```

#### `merge_sequence(tokens, n, pair_str, new_token)`

This function merges a specific token pair into a new token within a sequence.

*   **Scenario**: Merging the most frequent pair `(


"a", "b")` into `"ab"`.
*   **Inputs**:
    *   `tokens`: `["a", "b", "a", "b", "c"]`
    *   `n`: `5`
    *   `pair_str`: `"a\tb"`
    *   `new_token`: `"ab"`
*   **Internal Process**:
  
    1.  Initialize `new_tokens` as empty, `new_n = 0`, `i = 1`.
    2.  `i = 1`: `tokens[1]` is "a", `tokens[2]` is "b". Matches `pair_str`. Add `"ab"` to `new_tokens`. `new_n = 1`, `i = 3`.
    3.  `i = 3`: `tokens[3]` is "a", `tokens[4]` is "b". Matches `pair_str`. Add `"ab"` to `new_tokens`. `new_n = 2`, `i = 5`.
    4.  `i = 5`: `tokens[5]` is "c". Does not match. Add `"c"` to `new_tokens`. `new_n = 3`, `i = 6`.
    5.  Loop ends.
    6.  Update original `tokens` array with `new_tokens`.
*   **Output (updated `tokens` array and `n`)**:
    *   `tokens`: `["ab", "ab", "c"]`
    *   `n`: `3`

#### `train_bpe(text, num_merges)`

This function trains the BPE tokenizer. A full example would be very long, so we provide a conceptual one.

*   **Scenario**: Training BPE on a simple text with a small number of merges.
*   **Inputs**:
    *   `text`: `"banana"`
    *   `num_merges`: `2`
*   **Internal Process (Conceptual)**:
    1.  **Initial Vocabulary**: `V = 3` (`b`, `a`, `n`). `token2id` and `id2token` are populated.
    2.  **Initial `bpe_seq`**: `["b", "a", "n", "a", "n", "a"]`
    3.  **Merge 1**: `get_pair_stats` identifies `("a", "n")` as the most frequent pair (appears twice). It merges to `"an"`.
        *   `new_token`: `"an"`
        *   `ranked_merges[1, "p1"] = "a"`, `ranked_merges[1, "p2"] = "n"`, `ranked_merges[1, "new"] = "an"`
        *   `bpe_seq` becomes `["b", "an", "an", "a"]`
        *   `V` increases to `4` (adds `"an"`)
    4.  **Merge 2**: `get_pair_stats` identifies `("an", "a")` as the most frequent pair (appears twice). It merges to `"ana"`.
        *   `new_token`: `"ana"`
        *   `ranked_merges[2, "p1"] = "an"`, `ranked_merges[2, "p2"] = "a"`, `ranked_merges[2, "new"] = "ana"`
        *   `bpe_seq` becomes `["b", "ana", "ana"]`
        *   `V` increases to `5` (adds `"ana"`)
*   **Output (Conceptual)**:
    *   `V`: `5`
    *   `token2id`: Contains mappings for `b`, `a`, `n`, `an`, `ana`.
    *   `id2token`: Contains inverse mappings.
    *   `num_ranked_merges`: `2`
    *   `ranked_merges`: Stores the two merge operations.

#### `tokenize_bpe(text)`

This function tokenizes text using the learned BPE merges.

*   **Scenario**: Tokenizing `"banana"` after the `train_bpe` example above.
*   **Inputs**:
    *   `text`: `"banana"`
*   **Internal Process (Conceptual)**:
    1.  Initial `tokens`: `["b", "a", "n", "a", "n", "a"]`
    2.  Apply `ranked_merges[1]` (`a` + `n` -> `an`):
        *   `tokens` becomes `["b", "an", "an", "a"]`
    3.  Apply `ranked_merges[2]` (`an` + `a` -> `ana`):
        *   `tokens` becomes `["b", "ana", "ana"]`
    4.  Convert to IDs using `token2id`.
*   **Output (Conceptual)**:
    *   `seq`: `[id_b, id_ana, id_ana]` (where `id_b`, `id_ana` are the integer IDs for `"b"` and `"ana"`)
    *   `T`: `3`

### 5.3 Core Transformer Functions Examples (Conceptual)

Providing detailed numerical examples for `multihead_attention`, `process_block`, and `forward_logits_for_context` is impractical due to the high dimensionality and iterative nature of these operations. Instead, we will provide conceptual examples of their inputs and outputs, highlighting the data transformations that occur.

#### `multihead_attention(X, block_len, d, n_heads, d_head, WQ, WK, WV, W_out, attn_out, ...)`

*   **Purpose**: Computes the multi-head self-attention output.
*   **Conceptual Input (`X`)**:
    Imagine `X` as a matrix where each row represents a token in the input sequence, and each column represents a dimension of its embedding. For `block_len = 3` and `d = 8`:
    ```
    X = [
        [x1_1, x1_2, ..., x1_8],  // Embedding for Token 1
        [x2_1, x2_2, ..., x2_8],  // Embedding for Token 2
        [x3_1, x3_2, ..., x3_8]   // Embedding for Token 3
    ]
    ```
    `WQ`, `WK`, `WV`, `W_out` are matrices of learned weights.

*   **Conceptual Output (`attn_out`)**:
    `attn_out` will be a matrix of the same dimensions as `X`, but with each token's embedding now enriched with contextual information from other tokens in the sequence, weighted by their relevance.
    ```
    attn_out = [
        [att1_1, att1_2, ..., att1_8],  // Contextualized embedding for Token 1
        [att2_1, att2_2, ..., att2_8],  // Contextualized embedding for Token 2
        [att3_1, att3_2, ..., att3_8]   // Contextualized embedding for Token 3
    ]
    ```

#### `process_block(start, end, ...)`

*   **Purpose**: Performs a full forward and backward pass for a block of tokens during training.
*   **Conceptual Inputs**:
    *   `start`, `end`: Define the segment of the `seq` (token IDs) and `tgt` (target token IDs) arrays to process.
    *   All global weight matrices (`E`, `P`, `WQ`, `WK`, `WV`, `W_out`, `W1`, `W2`).
*   **Conceptual Outputs**:
    *   `loss`: A single numerical value representing how well the model predicted the next tokens in the block compared to the `tgt` values. A lower loss indicates better performance.
    *   **Updated Global Weight Matrices**: All weight matrices (`E`, `P`, `WQ`, `WK`, `WV`, `W_out`, `W1`, `W2`) will have their values adjusted slightly based on the calculated gradients, moving the model towards better predictions.

#### `forward_logits_for_context(ctx_ids, L, logits, ...)`

*   **Purpose**: Predicts the raw scores (logits) for the next possible token given a sequence of context tokens.
*   **Conceptual Inputs**:
    *   `ctx_ids`: An array of token IDs representing the input sequence for which the model should predict the next token. For example, `[id_of_the, id_of_quick, id_of_brown]`.
    *   `L`: The length of `ctx_ids` (e.g., `3`).
    *   All global weight matrices (`E`, `P`, `WQ`, `WK`, `WV`, `W_out`, `W1`, `W2`).
*   **Conceptual Output (`logits`)**:
    `logits` will be an associative array where keys are token IDs and values are their corresponding raw scores. These scores indicate the model's confidence that a particular token is the next in the sequence. Higher scores mean higher probability.
    ```
    logits = [
        id_of_fox: 5.2,   // High score for 'fox'
        id_of_dog: 1.1,   // Lower score for 'dog'
        id_of_cat: -0.5,  // Even lower score for 'cat'
        ...
    ]
    ```
    To get probabilities, a softmax function would typically be applied to these logits.

### 5.4 Model Saving/Loading Functions Examples

#### `save_model(fname)`

*   **Purpose**: Saves the entire model state to a file.
*   **Inputs**:
    *   `fname`: `"my_transformer_model.awk"`
*   **Output**: A file named `my_transformer_model.awk` will be created in the current directory. This file will contain all the necessary information to reconstruct the model, including hyperparameters, vocabulary mappings, BPE merges, and all learned weight values. The content will be in a format readable by AWK, looking similar to the initial `BEGIN` block and array assignments.

#### `load_model(fname)`

*   **Purpose**: Loads a model from a saved file.
*   **Inputs**:
    *   `fname`: `"my_transformer_model.awk"`
*   **Output**: All global variables and arrays (`V`, `d`, `token2id`, `E`, `WQ`, etc.) will be populated with the values read from `my_transformer_model.awk`, effectively restoring the model to its saved state.

This section provides a practical understanding of how data flows through the functions and what their expected outcomes are, complementing the theoretical explanations and diagrams. The next step is to assemble the complete documentation and deliver it to the user.
